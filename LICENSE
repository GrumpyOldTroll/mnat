Please note that this repository also contains some code copied from [jetconf](https://github.com/CZ-NIC/jetconf) that is licensed by its authors under the GPLv3.  That code is located under the cert_gen directory in server/local-test, and contains its separate license in the README.md in that directory:

 * <server/local-test/cert_gen/>

That code is used as a utility script for generating certificates, and is not in operation as part of the running code in any part of the MNAT implementation.  It's copied here as a convenience.
